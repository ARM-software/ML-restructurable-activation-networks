## Pretrained Weights
Due to the size of the files for pretrained weights, [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used to assign pointers to the weights files by default.
In order to download the actual weights, first ensure you have _git-lfs_ installed, then run one of the following shell commands.

> ```git lfs pull --include=pretrained/RAN_i_pretrained/img_cls_imagenet/  # To only download the RAN-i image-classification weights```
>
> ```git lfs pull  # To download all the pretrained weights```
